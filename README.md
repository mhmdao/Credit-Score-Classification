# üè¶ Credit Score Classification
## üìå Overview
The company has collected basic bank details and gathered a lot of credit-related information. This project focuses on **predicting credit scores** based on financial and demographic data, which implies the probability of loan default. A credit score is a crucial factor used by financial institutions to assess the creditworthiness of an individual. This project leverages machine learning techniques to classify individuals into different credit score categories.

## üéØ Objective
- ‚úÖ The purpose of this project is to build an intelligent system to segregate the people into credit score brackets to reduce the manual efforts.
- ‚úÖ Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand key factors affecting credit scores.
- ‚úÖ Build a **classification model** to predict credit scores.
- ‚úÖ Evaluate model performance using various metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
- ‚úÖ Deploy the model for potential real-world applications (if applicable).

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Workflow

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preprocessing and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Exploring data and features
- Encoding categorical features
- Distribution of credit scores
- Correlation between income, bank accounts, and credit score
- Impact of delayed payments on credit score

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Model Development**
- Tried different classification models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting
- Evaluated using:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision, Recall, F1-score
  - Confusion Matrix

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Results & Insights**
- **Feature Importance**: Outstanding Debt, Late Payments and interest rates significantly impact credit scores.
- **Best Model:** Gradient boosting achieved the highest accuracy (~87%).
- **Key Finding:** Customers with less outstanding debt and less interest rate tend to have **Good** credit scores. Secondly, people with middle range values of debt has a higher probability of poor credit score / more chance of loan default, which is likely because of other features such as salary or interest rate. Also, while the top 9 features significantly impact predictions, the sum of the 15 less important features also plays a crucial role in predicting the credit score based on the shap values. Therefore, they should not necessarily be removed from the model.
